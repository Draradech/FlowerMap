# Flower Map

Shows the flower gradient, minimap-style. As the gradient is 3-dimensional since 1.18, this mod has control over the y level for which the map is rendered. By default it uses the players y pos, but it can be switched to manual y mode, which can be controlled via keybinds.

This does work in multiplayer without entering the seed, as long as the biomes haven't been modified via datapack on the server side.
